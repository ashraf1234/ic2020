#summary Installation

= Introduction =

Welcome to our code repository. We've posted the source code that we've been working on for the last few months. We hope someone will find it useful!

Just a warning, but this code was thrown together fairly quickly, it will probably not be easy to understand, commenting is fairly minimal, etc.


= Details =

Additional things you will need:
  * ROS [we used cturtle]
  * ROS's kinect package [the deprecated one =( ]
  * GPU SURF ( http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~ncorneli/gpusurf/ )

Just to give a quick overview of the system flow:
  1) kinect_camera
  2) ic2020_optflow
  3) ic2020_surf
  4) ic2020_vodom
  5) ic2020_loop
  6) ic2020_toro
  7) ic2020_render

For those of you familiar with our video:

We developed a modified version of kinect_camera that streams the colour and disparity image over a wireless-N network. That code has not been cleaned at all, so we will not be releasing it as of now.
